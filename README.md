# Automatic Proof Generalization

This is supplementary material for the ITP 2025 submission _Automatically Generalizing Proofs and Statements_ containing a Lean implementation of the automatic proof generalization algorithm.

## Installation

Running the code in this repository requires a [working installation of the Lean theorem prover](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

Once Lean is set up, run

```bash
lake exe cache get
```

in the terminal to download the dependencies.

The relevant examples are in the `Demo.lean` file in the top-level directory of this folder.
